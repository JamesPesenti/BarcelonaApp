        history: "The Sagrada Família, an unfinished minor basilica in the Eixample district of Barcelona Spain. It is currently the largest unfinished Roman Catholic church and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, he combined Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete. Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Família's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War",
